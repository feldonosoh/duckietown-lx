# **Learning Experience (LX): Introduction to ROS**

# About these activities

In this learning experience you will learn what ROS is, why it is useful in robotics and how to use it.

This learning experience is provided by the Duckietown team and can be run on Duckiebots. Visit us at the 
[Duckietown Website](https://www.duckietown.com) for more learning materials, documentation, and demos.

# Instructions

**NOTE:** All commands below are intended to be executed from the root directory of this exercise (i.e., the directory containing this README).


## 1. Make sure your exercise is up-to-date

Update your exercise definition and instructions,

    git pull upstream duckiedrone-lxs

**NOTE:** Example instructions to fork a repository and configure to pull from upstream can be found in the [duckietown-lx repository README](https://github.com/duckietown/duckietown-lx/blob/mooc2022/README.md).


## 2. Make sure your system is up-to-date

- 💻 Always make sure your Duckietown Shell is updated to the latest version. See [installation instructions](https://github.com/duckietown/duckietown-shell)

- 💻 Update the shell commands: `dts update`

- 💻 Update your laptop/desktop: `dts desktop update`


## 3. Work on the exercise

### Launch the code editor

Open the code editor by running the following command,

```
dts code editor
```

Wait for a URL to appear on the terminal, then click on it or copy-paste it in the address bar
of your browser to access the code editor. The first thing you will see in the code editor is
this same document, you can continue there.


### Walkthrough of notebooks

**NOTE**: You should be reading this from inside the code editor in your browser.

Inside the code editor, use the navigator sidebar on the left-hand side to navigate to the
`notebooks` directory and open the first notebook.

Follow the instructions on the notebook and work through the notebooks in sequence.


### 💻 Testing in simulation

To test in simulation, use the command

    $ dts code workbench --sim

There will be two URLs popping up to open in your browser: one is the direct view of the
simulated environment. The other is VNC and only useful for some exercises, follow the instructions
in the notebooks to see if you need to access VNC.

This simulation test is just that, a test. Don't trust it fully. If you want a more accurate
metric of performance, continue reading to the `Perform local evaluation` section below.

## Troubleshooting


If an error of this form occurs

```bash
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/duckietown_challenges_cli/cli.py", line 76, in dt_challenges_cli_main
    dt_challenges_cli_main_(args=args, sections=sections, main_cmd="challenges")
  File "/usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/duckietown_challenges_cli/cli.py", line 203, in dt_challenges_cli_main_
    f(rest, environment)
  File "/usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/duckietown_challenges_cli/cli_submit.py", line 165, in dt_challenges_cli_submit
    br = submission_build(
  File "/usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/duckietown_challenges_cli/cmd_submit_build.py", line 41, in submission_build
    raise ZException(msg, available=list(credentials))
zuper_commons.types.exceptions.ZException: Credentials for registry docker.io not available
available:
```

you need to log into docker using `dts`. Use this command:

```
dts challenges config --docker-username <USERNAME> --docker-password <PASSWORD>
```


## Retire obsolete submissions

Note that you can "retire" submissions that you know are wrong.
You can do this through [the Duckietown Challenges website](https://challenges.duckietown.org/).

To do so, login using your token, then find the submission you want to retire from the list of submission
in your user profile page. Use the button "retire" to the right of the submission record line.
